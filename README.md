__double_pendulum.py__
I had some problems getting the writer for the animation to work. I tested it out with some initial values, and managed to make a (very) short animation.
But when I tried to put in the correct values I got multiple error messages. I tried to update matplotlib, but then I could not even make another animation.
Tried a lot of different things to make it work, but I did not succeed. I have added the short animation to the repository, as this was the best I could do.
